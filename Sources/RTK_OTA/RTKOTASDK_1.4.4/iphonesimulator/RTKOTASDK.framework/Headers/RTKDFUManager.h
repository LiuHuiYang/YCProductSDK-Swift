 * Dont call @c -scanForPeripherals: which is inherit from @c RTKProfileConnectionManager on this class instance to scan for neaby devices, this class only support scan for OTA mode device and companion device.

When a device switches to OTA mode, call this method to discover the device in OTA mode. When the device in OTA mode is discovered, the @c handler block is invoked with @c otaModeDevice parameter set to object that represents in OTA mode device.
