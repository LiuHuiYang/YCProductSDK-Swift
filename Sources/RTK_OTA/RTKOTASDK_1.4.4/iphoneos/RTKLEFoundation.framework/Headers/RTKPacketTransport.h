 * An abstract class that you can use to send and receive packet data.

 * @discussion An concrete RTKPacketTransport object sends packets to remote device and receive packets from remote device. You call @c -send:completionHandler: to send a data. When transport object receives a packet, it call @c -transport:didReceive: on its delegate object.
 *
 * To send or receive packets, a transport object's state should be @c RTKPacketTransportStatusOpen . If it is not, you call @c open method to initiates opening operation.
 *
 * RTKPacketTransport conforms to RTKPacketTransportClient protocol, which means a transport can be served by another transport. An RTKPacketTransport object may base on another transport object, becoming a client of this transport.
 *
 * An transport has a list of clients which it serves, it calls @c RTKPacketTransportClient defined methods to report state events and received data on each clients. You can add more objects into this list or remove a object from this list.
