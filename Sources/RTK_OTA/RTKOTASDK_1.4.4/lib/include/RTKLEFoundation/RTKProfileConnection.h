// Which term is better, Connection or Session or Communication ?
/**
 * The abstract base class that represents a application profile connection to a remote device which manage communication with it.
 *
 * @discussion A little different from meaning of a CBPeripheral connection, this class instance does not indicate a live connected state with a remote device. It represents a relationship between local app and remote device in the perspective of a application profile, whether the device is now connected to this phone or not.
 * Typically, a RTKProfileConnection subclass object has knowledge of a paricular profile and implements the profile client role. You use RTKProfileConnection (or subclass) objects for communicating with a connected device using particular profile protocol, such as obtaining device state, initiates device actions.
 *
 * The communication may takes place upon GATT profile which you uses @c RTKConnectionUponGATT , or upon iAP profile which you uses @c RTKConnectionUponiAP . Call @c +connectionWithPeripheral: to create a connection object which manages connection with a GATT peripheral. Call @c +connectionWithAccessory: to create a connection object which manages connection with a iAP accessory.
 *
 * You call @c -openWithComletionHandler: to make a connection to be open. A connection object should be open before receives any methods that making a real application communication. The device should be connected before begins open. When open method is called, the connection first verify profile compliance of the connected device.
 *
 * You can call @c -sendMessageData:withCompletionHandler: to send a custom data to remote device if the profile supports.
 *
 *  TODO: override notes
