/**
 * A general purpose object that you use to wait for an asynchronous task to be completed.
 *
 * @discussion Once you have an @c RTKOperationWaitor object, call @c -wait or @c -waitWithTimeout: to begin waiting, then call @c -cancel to stop waiting. The completion handler you pass to @c -initWithToken:completionHandler: will be invoked when either the waitting task is complete or time out occurs. You call @c -fulfillWithUserInfo: to tell the waitor task completion and the waitor then calls completion handler with @c success set to @c YES and @c error set to nil. If time out occurs, the completion handler is invoked with @c success set to @c NO and @c error set to a valid error object. A completed (fulfulled or time out) waitor can not receive @c -wait method, nor @c -cancel and @c -fulfill methods.
 *
 * When you call @c -fulfillWithUserInfo: with a non-nil pointer as @c userInfo, this pointer will be pass to @c userInfo parameter of the completion handler.
 *
 * You can use @c token property to associate any value to a waitor. If you pass an object as token parameter to @c -initWithToken:completionHandler: , the token is assigned the the object pointer value without retain it.
