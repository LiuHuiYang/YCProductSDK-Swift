The device can be a GATT profile connected device (respresendted as @c CBPeripheral instance), or iAP profile connected device (represented as @c EAAccessory instance). When upgrade a GATT device, you call @c -initWithPeripheral: initializer, and the  @c RTKDFUUpgradeGATT subclass  object is actually returned. @c RTKDFUUpgradeIAP subclass object is actually returned when call @c -initWithAccessory: for upgrade a iAP device.
 *
 * If you have a @c RTKDFUUpgrade object at hand for upgrade, call @c -prepareForUpgrade prior to calling any  @c -upgrade: methods, and wait for @c -DFUUpgradeDidReadyForUpgrade: and @c -DFUUpgrade:couldNotUpgradeWithError: get called on your delegate object. You can call @c -upgrade: methods to start upgrade only after @c -DFUUpgradeDidReadyForUpgrade: get called. In principle, every @c -upgrade: invocation should be preceded by a @c -DFUUpgradeDidReadyForUpgrade: invocation.
 *
 * When the delegate @c -DFUUpgradeDidReadyForUpgrade: get called, you can access @c deviceInfo to fetch upgrade related information of the device.
 *
 * If the remote device to be upgraded is a member of RWS bud pair, @c RTKDFUUpgrade will automatically discover and upgrade the companion device if the companion device is online (engaged). You call @c -upgradeWithImages: to upgrade a single device, call @c -upgradeWithImagesForPrimaryBud:imagesForSecondaryBud: to upgrade a RWS pair devices. The @c images or @c primaryImages and @c secondaryImages should be appropriate for device, @c RTKDFUUpgrade may complain of image mismatch, or old images. You can also call @c -upgradeWithBinaryFileAtPath: with a image file path, @c RTKDFUUpgrade will parse and extract available images for upgrade.
 *
 * For device that support bank switch feature, @c RTKDFUUpgrade may select a subset of passed images applicable for next upgrade. You can call APIs of @c RTKOTADeviceInfo object to know this information.
 *
 * @c RTKDFUUpgrade will report upgrade progress and event by call @c RTKDFUUpgradeDelegate methods on your delegate while in upgrading. @c RTKDFUUpgrade conforms to @c NSProgressReporting protocol to return a overall progress object.
 *
 * Everytime upgrade complete successfully or unsuccessfully, @c RTKDFUUpgrade report by calling your delegate  @c -DFUUpgrade:didFinishUpgradeWithError: . When @c RTKDFUUpgrade object is upgrading in progress, you can call @c -cancelUpgrade to request cancel upgrade, your delegate @c -DFUUpgrade:didFinishUpgradeWithError: get called when canceling complete.
